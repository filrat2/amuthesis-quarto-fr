		The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the
		approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the
		Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European
		Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface
		by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are
		the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard
		multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to
		provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate
		change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite
		missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral
		instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use
		classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have
		been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use
		monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the
		contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2)
		exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g.,
		forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows
		that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring,
		specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water
		resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can
		be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium
		spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the
		availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to
		integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data
		analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2
		images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data,
		especially in developing countries where financial resources for the
		acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows
		that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (\&gt;80\%) with
		machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random
		forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis
		are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land
		cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with
		Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial
		resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and
		have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use
		monitoring.

		Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative
		of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed
		to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational
		monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role
		in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and
		ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity
		to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations
		over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2
		are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution
		multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced
		continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour
		l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide
		observations for the next generation of operational products such as
		land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables.
		Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring,
		Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user
		requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral
		Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with
		13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the
		short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10m to 60m depending
		on the spectral band with a 290km field of view. This unique combination of
		high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will
		represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions.
		The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime
		over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in
		2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in
		the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five
		days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2
		mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1
		data processing and operational applications.

		Very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery from Google Earth and Microsoft
		Bing Maps is increasingly being used in a variety of applications from
		computer sciences to arts and humanities. In the field of remote sensing, one
		use of this imagery is to create reference data sets through visual
		interpretation, e.g., to complement existing training data or to aid in the
		validation of land-cover products. Through new applications such as Collect
		Earth, this imagery is also being used for monitoring purposes in the form of
		statistical surveys obtained through visual interpretation. However, little
		is known about where VHR satellite imagery exists globally or the dates of
		the imagery. Here we present a global overview of the spatial and temporal
		distribution of VHR satellite imagery in Google Earth and Microsoft Bing
		Maps. The results show an uneven availability globally, with biases in
		certain areas such as the USA, Europe and India, and with clear
		discontinuities at political borders. We also show that the availability of
		VHR imagery is currently not adequate for monitoring protected areas and
		deforestation, but is better suited for monitoring changes in cropland or
		urban areas using visual interpretation.

		Random Forests are considered for classification of multisource remote

		are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but
		bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or
		bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression
		tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset
		of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the
		correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not
		sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on
		weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based
		on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use
		of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We
		compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known

		Rapid and uncontrolled population growth along with economic and industrial
		development, especially in developing countries during the late twentieth and
		early twenty-first centuries, have increased the rate of land-use/land-cover
		(LULC) change many times. Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is
		one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land
		transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different
		algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classifier for
		further applications of earth observations. In this article, six
		machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector
		machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance
		theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper
		(SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was
		performed by using Kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (RoC),
		index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa
		coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with
		minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and
		the MD algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In
		addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF
		algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised differentiation water
		index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised
		differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05
		level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the
		other classifiers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN
		and RF algorithms are the best LULC classifiers, although a non-parametric
		classifier like SAM (Kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has
		a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning
		algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best
		machine-learning LULC classifier, among the six examined algorithms although
		it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in different morphoclimatic
		conditions in the future.

		The satellite image time series are used for several applications such as
		predictive analysis. New techniques such as deep learning (DL) algorithms
		generally require long sequences of data to perform well; however, the
		complexity of satellite image preprocessing tasks leads to a lack of
		preprocessed datasets. Moreover, using conventional collection and
		preprocessing methods is time- and storage-consuming. In this paper, a
		workflow for collecting, preprocessing, and preparing Sentinel-1 images to
		use with DL algorithms is proposed. The process mainly consists of using
		scripts for collecting and preprocessing operations. The goal of this work is
		not only to provide the community with easily modifiable programs for image
		collection and batch preprocessing but also to publish a database with
		prepared images. The experimental results allowed the researchers to build
		three time series of Sentinel-1 images corresponding to three study areas,
		namely the Bouba Ndjida National Park, the Dja Biosphere Reserve, and the
		Wildlife Reserve of Togodo. A total of 628 images were processed using
		scripts based on the SNAP graph processing tool (GPT). In order to test the
		effectiveness of the proposed methodology, three DL models were trained with
		the Bouba Ndjida and Togodo images for the prediction of the next occurrence
		in a sequence.

		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Geographic information system (GIS) software packages can be
		prohibitively expensive, causing many to shy away from mapping and spatial
		analysis. This 7-page fact sheet written by Jeffry M. Flenniken, Steven
		Stuglik, and Basil V. Iannone III and published by the UF/IFAS School of
		Forest Resources and Conservation introduces the reader to a free GIS
		software package called Quantum GIS (QGIS), walking the reader through simple
		GIS processes that can be used to visualize spatial patterns of importance to
		a variety of fields, including natural resources, agriculture, and urban
		planning. Learn how to create a land-cover map for a county of interest and
		create heatmaps that illustrate the density of a given attribute (Florida
		Springs for this example). This publication will benefit those interested in
		incorporating GIS into their work but who are unable to afford expensive
		proprietary GIS software packages, as well as anyone interested in learning a
		new GIS software package.
