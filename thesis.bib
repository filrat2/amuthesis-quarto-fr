		The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the
		approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the
		Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European
		Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface
		by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are
		the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard
		multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to
		provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate
		change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite
		missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral
		instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use
		classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have
		been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use
		monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the
		contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2)
		exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g.,
		forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows
		that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring,
		specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water
		resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can
		be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium
		spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the
		availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to
		integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data
		analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2
		images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data,
		especially in developing countries where financial resources for the
		acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows
		that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (\&gt;80\%) with
		machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random
		forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis
		are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land
		cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with
		Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial
		resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and
		have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use
		monitoring.

		Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative
		of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed
		to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational
		monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role
		in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and
		ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity
		to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations
		over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2
		are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution
		multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced
		continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour
		l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide
		observations for the next generation of operational products such as
		land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables.
		Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring,
		Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user
		requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral
		Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with
		13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the
		short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10m to 60m depending
		on the spectral band with a 290km field of view. This unique combination of
		high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will
		represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions.
		The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime
		over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in
		2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in
		the same orbit with a phase delay of 180Â° providing a revisit time of five
		days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2
		mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1
		data processing and operational applications.
