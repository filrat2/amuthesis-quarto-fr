		The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the
		approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the
		Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European
		Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface
		by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are
		the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard
		multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to
		provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate
		change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite
		missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral
		instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use
		classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have
		been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use
		monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the
		contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2)
		exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g.,
		forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows
		that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring,
		specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water
		resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can
		be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium
		spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the
		availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to
		integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data
		analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2
		images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data,
		especially in developing countries where financial resources for the
		acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows
		that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (\&gt;80\%) with
		machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random
		forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis
		are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land
		cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with
		Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial
		resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and
		have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use
		monitoring.

		Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative
		of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed
		to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational
		monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role
		in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and
		ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity
		to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations
		over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2
		are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution
		multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced
		continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour
		l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide
		observations for the next generation of operational products such as
		land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables.
		Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring,
		Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user
		requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral
		Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with
		13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the
		short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10m to 60m depending
		on the spectral band with a 290km field of view. This unique combination of
		high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will
		represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions.
		The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime
		over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in
		2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in
		the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five
		days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2
		mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1
		data processing and operational applications.

		Very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery from Google Earth and Microsoft
		Bing Maps is increasingly being used in a variety of applications from
		computer sciences to arts and humanities. In the field of remote sensing, one
		use of this imagery is to create reference data sets through visual
		interpretation, e.g., to complement existing training data or to aid in the
		validation of land-cover products. Through new applications such as Collect
		Earth, this imagery is also being used for monitoring purposes in the form of
		statistical surveys obtained through visual interpretation. However, little
		is known about where VHR satellite imagery exists globally or the dates of
		the imagery. Here we present a global overview of the spatial and temporal
		distribution of VHR satellite imagery in Google Earth and Microsoft Bing
		Maps. The results show an uneven availability globally, with biases in
		certain areas such as the USA, Europe and India, and with clear
		discontinuities at political borders. We also show that the availability of
		VHR imagery is currently not adequate for monitoring protected areas and
		deforestation, but is better suited for monitoring changes in cropland or
		urban areas using visual interpretation.

		Random Forests are considered for classification of multisource remote

		bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or
		bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression
		tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset
		of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the
		correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not
		sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on
		weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based
		on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use
		of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We
		compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known

		The satellite image time series are used for several applications such as

		not only to provide the community with easily modifiable programs for image
		collection and batch preprocessing but also to publish a database with
		prepared images. The experimental results allowed the researchers to build
		three time series of Sentinel-1 images corresponding to three study areas,
		namely the Bouba Ndjida National Park, the Dja Biosphere Reserve, and the
		Wildlife Reserve of Togodo. A total of 628 images were processed using
		scripts based on the SNAP graph processing tool (GPT). In order to test the
		effectiveness of the proposed methodology, three DL models were trained with
		the Bouba Ndjida and Togodo images for the prediction of the next occurrence
		in a sequence.

		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Geographic information system (GIS) software packages can be
		prohibitively expensive, causing many to shy away from mapping and spatial
		analysis. This 7-page fact sheet written by Jeffry M. Flenniken, Steven
		Stuglik, and Basil V. Iannone III and published by the UF/IFAS School of
		Forest Resources and Conservation introduces the reader to a free GIS
		software package called Quantum GIS (QGIS), walking the reader through simple
		GIS processes that can be used to visualize spatial patterns of importance to
		a variety of fields, including natural resources, agriculture, and urban
		planning. Learn how to create a land-cover map for a county of interest and
		create heatmaps that illustrate the density of a given attribute (Florida
		Springs for this example). This publication will benefit those interested in
		incorporating GIS into their work but who are unable to afford expensive
		proprietary GIS software packages, as well as anyone interested in learning a
		new GIS software package.

		The Copernicus Programme has become the world’s largest space data provider,
		providing complete, free and open access to satellite data, mainly acquired
		by Sentinel satellites. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have
		improved spatial resolution and high revisit frequency, making them useful
		for a wide range of applications. While few research applications need
		Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) data with few corrections applied, a
		wider range of users needs products with a standard set of corrections
		applied. In order to facilitate the exploitation of Sentinel-1 GRD products,
		there is the need to standardise procedures to preprocess SAR data to a
		higher processing level. A standard generic workflow to preprocess Copernicus
		Sentinel-1 GRD data is presented here. The workflow aims to apply a series of
		standard corrections, and to apply a precise orbit of acquisition, remove
		thermal and image border noise, perform radiometric calibration, and apply
		range Doppler and terrain correction. Additionally, the workflow allows
		spatially snapping of Sentinel-1 GRD products to Sentinel-2 MSI data grids,
		in order to promote the use of satellite virtual constellations by means of
		data fusion techniques. The presented workflow allows the production of a set
		of preprocessed Sentinel-1 GRD data, offering a benchmark for the development
		of new products and operational down-streaming services based on consistent
		Copernicus Sentinel-1 GRD datasets, with the aim of providing reliable
		information of interest to a wide range of communities.

		For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as
		inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the
		most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift
		and regression kriging have become basic techniques that benefit both from
		spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine
		learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become
		increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some
		attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account
		in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the
		natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances
		to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the
		value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances
		from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial
		Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation
		methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random
		Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The first case
		study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed
		stationary random fields with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary
		kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated
		the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily
		precipitation data for the 2016&ndash;2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and
		mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic
		case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic
		interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance
		weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in
		the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies,
		RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting,
		random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp,
		particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution
		prediction maps were made.

		The paper presents a comparison of the efficacy of several texture analysis
		methods as tools for improving land use/cover classification in satellite
		imagery. The tested methods were: gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)
		features, Laplace filters and granulometric analysis, based on mathematical
		morphology. The performed tests included an assessment of the classification
		accuracy performed based on spectro-textural datasets: spectral images with
		the addition of images generated using different texture analysis methods.
		The class nomenclature was based on spectral and textural differences and
		included the following classes: water, low vegetation, bare soil, urban, and
		two (coniferous and deciduous) forest classes. The classification accuracy
		was assessed using the overall accuracy and kappa index of agreement, based
		on the reference data generated using visual interpretation of the images.
		The analysis was performed using very high-resolution imagery (Pleiades,
		WorldView-2) and high-resolution imagery (Sentinel-2). The results show the
		efficacy of selected GLCM features and granulometric analysis as tools for
		providing textural data, which could be used in the process of land use/cover
		classification. It is also clear that texture analysis is generally a more
		important and effective component of classification for images of higher
		resolution. In addition, for classification using GLCM results, the Random
		Forest variable importance analysis was performed.

		A large number of spatial feature extraction methods were developed during
		the past 20 years. The effectiveness of each method has been assessed in
		different studies using different data. However, there have been few
		application-oriented studies made to evaluate the relative powers of these
		methods in a particular environment. In this study, three spatial feature
		extraction methods have been compared in the land-use classification of the
		SPOT HRV multispectral data at the rural-urban fringe of Metropolitan
		Toronto. The first two methods are the well-known gray level co-occurrence
		matrix (GLCM) and the simple statistical transformation (SST). The third
		method is the texture spectrum (TS), which was developed recently.
		Twenty-seven spatial features were derived from the SPOT HRV Band 3 image
		using these methods. Each of these features or a combination of two of these
		features were used in combination with the three spectral images in the
		classification of 10 land-use classes. Results indicated that some spatial
		features derived using the GLCM and the SST methods can largely improve the
		classification accuracies obtained by the use of the spectral images only. In
		addition, average transformed divergence was found to be ineffective in
		selecting optimal spatial features for land-use classification.

		Remotely sensed imagery is ideally used to monitor and detect land cover
		changes that occur frequently in urban and peri-urban areas as a consequence
		of incessant urbanization. It is a lengthy process to convert satellite
		imagery into land cover map using the existing methods of manual
		interpretation and parametric image classification digitally. In this paper
		we propose a new method based on Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI)
		to automate the process of mapping built-up areas. It takes advantage of the
		unique spectral response of built-up areas and other land covers. Built-up
		areas are effectively mapped through arithmetic manipulation of re-coded
		Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDBI images derived from TM
		imagery. The devised NDBI method was applied to map urban land in the city of
		Nanjing, eastern China. The mapped results at an accuracy of 92.6\% indicate
		that it can be used to fulfil the mapping objective reliably. Compared with
		the maximum likelihood classification method, the proposed NDBI is able to
		serve as a worthwhile alternative for quickly and objectively mapping
		built-up areas.

		open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built‐up
		land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water
		information using the NDWI is often mixed with built‐up land noise and the
		area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more
		suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region
		with a background dominated by built‐up land areas because of its advantage

		The rapid increase in large-scale photovoltaic installations, or solar parks,
		causes a need to monitor their amount and allocation, and assess their
		impacts. While their spectral signature suggests that solar parks can be
		identified among other land covers, this detection is challenged by their low
		occurrence. Here, we develop an object-based random forest (RF)
		classification approach, using publicly available satellite imagery, which
		has the advantage of requiring relatively little training data and being
		easily extendable to large spatial extents and new areas. First, we segmented
		Sentinel-2 imagery into homogenous objects using a Simple Non-Iterative
		Clustering algorithm in Google Earth Engine. Thereafter, we calculated for
		each object the mean, standard deviation, and median for all 10- and 20-meter
		resolution bands of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. These features are
		subsequently used to train and validate a range of RF models to select the
		most promising model setup. The training datasets consisted of subsampled
		presence/absence data, oversampled presence/absence data, and multiple
		land-cover categories. The best-performing model used an oversampled dataset
		trained on all 10- and 20- meter resolution spectral bands and the radar
		backscatter properties of one period. Independent test results show an
		overall classification accuracy of 99.97\% (Kappa: 0.90). For this result,
		the producer accuracy was 85.86\% for solar park objects and 99.999\% for
		non-solar park objects. The user accuracy was 92.39\% for solar park objects
		and 99.999\% for non-solar park objects. These high classification accuracies
		indicate that our approach is suitable for transfer learning and is able to
		detect solar parks in new study areas.

		In machine learning, one often assumes the data are independent when
		evaluating model performance. However, this rarely holds in practice.
		Geographic information datasets are an example where the data points have
		stronger dependencies among each other the closer they are geographically.
		This phenomenon known as spatial autocorrelation (SAC) causes the standard
		cross validation (CV) methods to produce optimistically biased prediction
		performance estimates for spatial models, which can result in increased costs
		and accidents in practical applications. To overcome this problem, we propose
		a modified version of the CV method called spatial k-fold cross validation
		(SKCV), which provides a useful estimate for model prediction performance
		without optimistic bias due to SAC. We test SKCV with three real-world cases
		involving open natural data showing that the estimates produced by the
		ordinary CV are up to 40\% more optimistic than those of SKCV. Both
		regression and classification cases are considered in our experiments. In
		addition, we will show how the SKCV method can be applied as a criterion for
		selecting data sampling density for new research area.

		Speckle, appearing in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images as granular
		noise, is due to the interference of waves reflected from many elementary
		scatterers. Speckle in SAR images complicates the image interpretation
		problem by reducing the effectiveness of image segmentation and
		classification. To alleviate deleterious effects of speckle, various ways
		have been devised to suppress it. This paper surveys several better‐known
		speckle filtering algorithms. The concept of each filtering algorithm and the
		interrelationship between algorithms are discussed in detail. A set of
		performance criteria is established and comparisons are made for the
		effectiveness of these filters in speckle reduction and edge, line, and point
		target contrast preservation using a simulated SAR image as well as airborne
		and spaceborne SAR images. In addition, computational efficiency and
		implementation complexity are compared. This critical evaluation of speckle
		suppression filters is mostly new and is presented as a survey paper for the
		first time. It is believed that the information provided is sufficient for an
		intelligent selection of speckle filters for various applications.

		The main aim of spatial sampling is to collect samples in 1-, 2- or
		3-dimensional space. It is typically used to estimate the total or mean for a
		parameter in an area, to optimize parameter estimations for unsampled
		locations, or to predict the location of a movable object. Some objectives
		are for populations, representing the “here and now”, whereas other
		objectives concern superpopulations that generate the populations. Data to be
		collected are usually spatially autocorrelated and heterogeneous, whereas
		sampling is usually not repeatable. In various senses it is distinct from the
		assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data from a
		population in conventional sampling. The uncertainty for spatial sample
		estimation propagates along a chain from spatial variation in the stochastic
		field to sample distribution and statistical tools used to obtain an
		estimate. This uncertainty is measured using either a design-based or
		model-based method. Both methods can be used in population and
		superpopulation studies. An unbiased estimate with the lowest variance is
		thus a common goal in spatial sampling and inference. Reaching this objective
		can be addressed by sample allocation in an area to obtain a restricted
		objective function.
