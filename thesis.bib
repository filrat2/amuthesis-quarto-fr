		The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the
		approaches to monitoring the Earth's surface. The development of the
		Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European
		Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface
		by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are
		the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard
		multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to
		provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate
		change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite
		missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral
		instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use
		classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have
		been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use
		monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the
		contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2)
		exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g.,
		forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows
		that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring,
		specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water
		resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can
		be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium
		spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the
		availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to
		integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data
		analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2
		images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data,
		especially in developing countries where financial resources for the
		acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows
		that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (\&gt;80\%) with
		machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random
		forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis
		are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land
		cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with
		Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial
		resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and
		have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use
		monitoring.

		Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative
		of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed
		to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational
		monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role
		in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and
		ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity
		to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations
		over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2
		are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution
		multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced
		continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour
		l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide
		observations for the next generation of operational products such as
		land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables.
		Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring,
		Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user
		requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral
		Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with
		13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the
		short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10m to 60m depending
		on the spectral band with a 290km field of view. This unique combination of
		high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will
		represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions.
		The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime
		over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in
		2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in
		the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five
		days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2
		mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1
		data processing and operational applications.

		Very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery from Google Earth and Microsoft
		Bing Maps is increasingly being used in a variety of applications from
		computer sciences to arts and humanities. In the field of remote sensing, one
		use of this imagery is to create reference data sets through visual
		interpretation, e.g., to complement existing training data or to aid in the
		validation of land-cover products. Through new applications such as Collect
		Earth, this imagery is also being used for monitoring purposes in the form of
		statistical surveys obtained through visual interpretation. However, little
		is known about where VHR satellite imagery exists globally or the dates of
		the imagery. Here we present a global overview of the spatial and temporal
		distribution of VHR satellite imagery in Google Earth and Microsoft Bing
		Maps. The results show an uneven availability globally, with biases in
		certain areas such as the USA, Europe and India, and with clear
		discontinuities at political borders. We also show that the availability of
		VHR imagery is currently not adequate for monitoring protected areas and
		deforestation, but is better suited for monitoring changes in cropland or
		urban areas using visual interpretation.

		are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but
		bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or
		bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression
		tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset
		of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the
		correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not
		sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on
		weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based
		on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use
		of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We
		compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known

		The satellite image time series are used for several applications such as

		generally require long sequences of data to perform well; however, the

		scripts for collecting and preprocessing operations. The goal of this work is
		not only to provide the community with easily modifiable programs for image
		collection and batch preprocessing but also to publish a database with
		prepared images. The experimental results allowed the researchers to build
		three time series of Sentinel-1 images corresponding to three study areas,
		namely the Bouba Ndjida National Park, the Dja Biosphere Reserve, and the
		Wildlife Reserve of Togodo. A total of 628 images were processed using
		scripts based on the SNAP graph processing tool (GPT). In order to test the
		effectiveness of the proposed methodology, three DL models were trained with
		the Bouba Ndjida and Togodo images for the prediction of the next occurrence
		in a sequence.

		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Geographic information system (GIS) software packages can be
		prohibitively expensive, causing many to shy away from mapping and spatial
		analysis. This 7-page fact sheet written by Jeffry M. Flenniken, Steven
		Stuglik, and Basil V. Iannone III and published by the UF/IFAS School of
		Forest Resources and Conservation introduces the reader to a free GIS
		software package called Quantum GIS (QGIS), walking the reader through simple
		GIS processes that can be used to visualize spatial patterns of importance to
		a variety of fields, including natural resources, agriculture, and urban
		planning. Learn how to create a land-cover map for a county of interest and
		create heatmaps that illustrate the density of a given attribute (Florida
		Springs for this example). This publication will benefit those interested in
		incorporating GIS into their work but who are unable to afford expensive
		proprietary GIS software packages, as well as anyone interested in learning a
		new GIS software package.

		The Copernicus Programme has become the world’s largest space data provider,
		providing complete, free and open access to satellite data, mainly acquired
		by Sentinel satellites. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have
		improved spatial resolution and high revisit frequency, making them useful
		for a wide range of applications. While few research applications need
		Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) data with few corrections applied, a
		wider range of users needs products with a standard set of corrections
		applied. In order to facilitate the exploitation of Sentinel-1 GRD products,
		there is the need to standardise procedures to preprocess SAR data to a
		higher processing level. A standard generic workflow to preprocess Copernicus
		Sentinel-1 GRD data is presented here. The workflow aims to apply a series of
		standard corrections, and to apply a precise orbit of acquisition, remove
		thermal and image border noise, perform radiometric calibration, and apply
		range Doppler and terrain correction. Additionally, the workflow allows
		spatially snapping of Sentinel-1 GRD products to Sentinel-2 MSI data grids,
		in order to promote the use of satellite virtual constellations by means of
		data fusion techniques. The presented workflow allows the production of a set
		of preprocessed Sentinel-1 GRD data, offering a benchmark for the development
		of new products and operational down-streaming services based on consistent
		Copernicus Sentinel-1 GRD datasets, with the aim of providing reliable
		information of interest to a wide range of communities.

		For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as
		inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the
		most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift
		and regression kriging have become basic techniques that benefit both from
		spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine
		learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become
		increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some
		attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account
		in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the
		natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances
		to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the
		value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances
		from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial
		Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation
		methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random
		Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The first case
		study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed
		stationary random fields with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary
		kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated
		the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily
		precipitation data for the 2016&ndash;2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and
		mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic
		case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic
		interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance
		weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in
		the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies,
		RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting,
		random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp,
		particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution
		prediction maps were made.
